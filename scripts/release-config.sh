# Writes a release's settings into mygo.json, in place, for `mygo build`:
# the repository keeps none of them, so builds made without them (go run,
# mygo dev, scripts/mac.sh, CI's dry runs) are signed ad hoc and never
# update themselves (mygo.Updater.Enabled() is false). The release
# workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml) and scripts/release-local.sh
# run it on a copy they throw away or restore; never commit its output.
#
# Updates come from actnow.dev (threads #69, #71, scripts/actnow.sh): the
# app reads https://actnow.dev/updates/audiosmith/update-darwin-arm64.json,
# and with Receive beta updates on the beta/ one beside it too (MyGo patch
# 0008). Betas are built with that same url, not …/audiosmith/beta as the
# site suggests: MyGo already points a beta's archive and deltas into
# beta/ (which the site checks), and a beta with Receive beta updates off
# must read the releases' feed, not beta/. No updates.s3 or updates.github:
# the files go to the site through scripts/actnow-publish.sh. Up to
# 0.4.0-beta.4 the app read GitHub releases.
#
# From the environment, each optional:
#   MYGO_UPDATER_PUBLIC_KEY  contents of mygo-update.pub (mygo keygen): adds
#                            "updates": {publicKey, url}
#   MACOS_SIGNING_IDENTITY   "Developer ID Application: Name (TEAMID)" or
#                            its SHA-1: macos.signingIdentity
#   NOTARY_PROFILE           a notarytool keychain profile: macos.notarize
#   NOTARY_KEYCHAIN          the keychain holding it (CI's temporary one)
#
# GITHUB_FEED (release.yml's transition toggle) changes nothing here: the
# app always reads the website; release-publish.sh puts a copy of the
# update on GitHub for the copies that still read it.
#
#   scripts/release-config.sh            # edit mygo.json
