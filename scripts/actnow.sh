# where AudioSmith's releases go on the family website, actnow.dev
# (threads #69, #71). Not a program of its own.
#
# Every file goes through the site's release API (scripts/actnow-publish.sh,
# the site's own script, vendored), which checks it, stores it in its R2
# bucket and publishes it; CI holds only ACTNOW_INGEST_TOKEN. The site
# serves the update files publicly, and the disk images only through its
# sign-in download page (https://actnow.dev/download/audiosmith):
#
#   https://actnow.dev/updates/audiosmith/<file>       releases (channel stable)
#   https://actnow.dev/updates/audiosmith/beta/<file>  betas (channel beta); its
#                                                      manifest names the newer of both
#
# Every build, beta or not, has updates.url = ACTNOW_UPDATES_URL: MyGo
# (patch 0008) points a beta's archive and deltas into beta/, and the app
# reads beta/'s manifest as well only with Receive beta updates on.
