// Package dictation is what system-wide dictation needs of macOS beyond
// MyGo: the app that has the keyboard focus, bringing it back to the
// front, pasting into it with a synthetic ⌘V, the clipboard's change
// count, the release of a global shortcut (MyGo reports presses only),
// the Microphone and Accessibility permissions, and system sounds. On
// darwin it calls AppKit, Carbon, CoreGraphics, HIServices and
// AVFoundation through purego (no cgo); elsewhere Native reports nothing
// and refuses to paste, so the app's tests run on Linux with Fake.
//
// Insert is the delivery algorithm: put the text on the clipboard,
// reactivate the target app, send ⌘V, and put the user's clipboard back
// unless it changed meanwhile.
//
// Imports: nothing internal (mygo/transfer for clipboard contents).
